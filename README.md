# RDAMP-Dimensional-Model-PowerBI
This repository showcases my ability to build a structured, query optimized reporting system which incorporates dimensional modeling best practices.
#Objective
As a recap ACE Superstore is a nationawide retail chain which has seen significant sales growth over the period 2023 to the first quarter of 2025. The company is now preparing to expand into additional
regions across the United Kingdom and optimize its current operations. In keeping with the requirement outlined in TASK1, I have prepared a business intelligence report summarizing key sales performance 
trends along with recommendations for improvement.
Going a step further this leg of the project is geared towards designing a demensional model that is usable and scalable. This model should be one that business users can use to analyze performance from mmultiple angles
and in a format that is optimized for enterprise-grade reporting.
